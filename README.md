# Exercise 4
## Author: Lawas, Cresel M.
## Program Description: an Express JS web server that applies the concepts of GET and POST methods. GET methods accept requests for searching a book by author, or by author and isbn. Meanwhile, POST methods are for adding books into a text file.

### Things you did in the code
### I created if conditions to satisfy the project specifications.
### I also got to explore array and Object functions, which I have not encountered before, through this exercise.
### It took me a while to understand what should happen and how to debug my own code, but with the help of two other CMSC 100 takers (Karl and Rainier), I was eventually able to understand where to put the console.log()'s to find my own errors.
